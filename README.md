# White Flight in Higher Education?

## By Laura Hamilton, Charlie Eaton, and Simon Cheng

Summary: We utilized nearly 30 years of longitudinal annual college-level surveys of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to conduct event studies and trend break analyses testing for statistically significant changes in race-specific first- year enrollment after Hispanic-Serving (HSI) designation at four-year universities in the United States.

**Abstract**
Scholars have demonstrated that white families frequently avoid K-12 schools attended by racially marginalized populations, contributing to persistent racial segregation in a post-Brown v. Board of Education era. To date, however, there has not been a systematic assessment of white flight in higher education. We utilized nearly 30 years of longitudinal annual college-level surveys of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to conduct event studies and trend break analyses testing for statistically significant changes in race-specific first- year enrollment after Hispanic-Serving (HSI) designation at four-year universities in the United States. The transition to HSI offers a natural experiment to identify flight behaviors among privileged populations. Our findings indicate that both white and Asian families avoid colleges and universities racially marked as “for” Latinx students. Declining white and Asian enrollments after the transition to HSI are apparent in public universities and, in more recent decades, at private universities. Additionally, postsecondary schools often raise first-year Latinx enrollments to cross the 25 percent threshold necessary to access federal Title V funds associated with HSI status—but then artificially cap Latinx enrollment. We argue that these individual and organizational behaviors are a reflection of U.S. higher education as a racialized status system.

The repository has a separate ".ipynb" (iPython NoteBook) for each table and figure paper. Table names all start t1_, t2_ etc. for table 1, table 2 etc. Figure names all start f1, f2, etc. Appendix tables are ta1, ta2, etc.

If you click on the link for an .ipnyb for any given table/figure in the repository, Github will render both the code and any figures or tables from the notebook.

If the table formatting is funny with lines running over, use "⌘-" (control minus) to zoom your browser out. The following is the rendering of Figure 1 with the "dubois" stata scheme to use Du Boisian style elements (see https://www.dignityanddebt.org/projects/du-boisian-resources/):
