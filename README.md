Replication package for "White Flight in Higher Education?"

The repository has a separate ".ipynb" (iPython NoteBook) for each table and figure paper. Table names all start t1_, t2_ etc. for table 1, table 2 etc. Figure names all start f1, f2, etc. Appendix tables are ta1, ta2, etc.

If you click on the link for an .ipnyb for any given table/figure in the repository, Github will render both the code and any figures or tables from the notebook.

If the table formatting is funny with lines running over, use "âŒ˜-" (control minus) to zoom your browser out.
